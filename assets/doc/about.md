## General


## Hearts

### Rules
The goal is to have the lowest score by avoiding points. A match consists of multiple rounds and
ends when one player reaches 100 points. Points are scored by taking hearts and the queen of spades.

After the cards are dealt for each round, there is usually a passing step. In this step each player
selects three cards to pass to an opponent. The pass direction cycles between left, right, across,
and then a round without passing.

In each round, players play cards one at a time in "tricks". One player leads a trick by playing a
card. Each other player must play a card of the same suit as the first card if possible. If
not, they may play any card. After each player has played a card, whoever played the highest ranking
card of the suit that was led takes all the cards.

The player with the two of clubs leads it for the first trick. After that, whoever takes each
trick leads the next one. You cannot lead hearts unless a heart has been played on a previous trick.
Note: the first trick of a round is "safe"; players are not allowed to play hearts or the queen of
spades, even if they have no clubs.

### Scoring
When a round is over, each player gets 1 point for each heart they took, and 13 points for taking
the queen of spades. The match is over when one or more players have taken at least 100 points, and
the player with the lowest score wins. This means that you generally want to avoid taking
points, but there is a special rule: if a player takes all 13 hearts and the queen of spades, that
player score zero points and all their opponents score 26. This is called "shooting the moon".

### Optional rules
These rules can be configured in the Preferences screen from the main menu.
- J♦ is -10 points: If enabled, the player who takes the jack of diamonds scores -10 points at the
end of the round.
- Q♠ breaks hearts: Normally, you cannot lead a heart to start a trick unless hearts have been
"broken" by being played on a previous trick. If this option is enabled, playing the queen of spades
also allows hearts to be led in subsequent tricks.
- Allow points on first trick: Normally, points (hearts and the queen of spades) cannot be played on
the first trick of a round. If this option is enabled, they can be.

## Spades

## Rules
There are two teams in spades. Your partner is at the top of the screen, and your opponents are on
the sides. The goal is to reach 500 points by bidding on how many tricks you will take in each
round, and then taking that many while preventing your opponents from doing the same. Spades are
always the trump suit.

A round starts with each player making a bid, which is a declaration of how many tricks they expect
to win. Bids of zero (called "nil") are treated specially; see the Scoring section. After all
players have made a bid, the first bidder (this rotates every round) leads the first trick.

In each trick, each player after the leader must play a card of the same suit as the first card if
possible. If not, they may play any card. Spades are trumps, so if any spade is played then the
highest spade wins the trick. If there are no spades, then the highest card in the suit that was
led wins the trick.a

The winner of each trick leads the next trick. Spades cannot be led until a spade has been played
on a previous trick.

### Scoring
If you and your partner make your combined bid, you score 10 points for each trick that you bid.
(It doesn't matter how many tricks you individually take, only whether the total number of tricks
is at least the total bid). If you fail to make your combined bid, you lose 10 points for each
trick that you bid.

For each trick that a team takes over the bid amount, 1 point is scored. These points are called
"bags", and if a team accumulates 10 or more bags they lose 110 points. (This encourages not being
overly cautious when bidding).

If a player bids nil and successfully takes no tricks, the team scores 100 points. But if the
player takes one or more tricks, the team loses 100 points.
