# Cards With Cats

Play Hearts or Spades with computer-controlled opponents.

Built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), and runs on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and probably Windows.

If you're building on Android, you'll need to specify the "std" [build flavor](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/flavors). There's also an "fdroid" flavor, which is only for building the release for F-Droid.
